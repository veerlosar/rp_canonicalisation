# Relation Canonicalization

This is the repository for our ongoing project on the canonicalization of relation phrases (RPs) in triples extracted from Open IE approaches.

The files in the _dataset_ folder contain normalized and non-normalized versions of the relation phrases for 163 relations derived from the NELL knowledge graph. The expansion and further refinement of this dataset is under progress. The code will be updated soon. 

A poster describing the construction of this dataset for the evaluation of existing relation canonicalization techniques has been accepted to the [ESWC 2022](https://2022.eswc-conferences.org/) conference to be held in Greece from May 29 to June 2, 2022.
